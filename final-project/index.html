                        The Association of American Universities on Monday
                        released the overall results of a survey that asked
                        students at 27 universities about their experiences with
                        sexual assault and sexual misconduct, drawing responses
                        from more than 150,000 students.

                    <p>
                        More than 20 percent of female undergraduates at an
                        array of prominent universities said this year they were
                        victims of sexual assault and misconduct, echoing
                        findings elsewhere, according to one of the largest
                        studies ever of college sexual violence.

                        Here are key data and reactions from universities that
                        participated in the AAU’s joint study of sexual assault
                        this year. All schools are AAU members, except Dartmouth
                        College. This file will be updated.

                        (For comparison, here are some overall figures: The
                        survey found that 23 percent of undergraduate women and
                        5 percent of undergraduate men said they were victims of
                        non-consensual sexual contact – ranging from penetration
                        to sexual touching — due to force or incapacitation.
                        Eleven percent of undergraduate women said they were
                        victims of non-consensual penetration or attempted
                        penetration.

                    <p>
                        Another key overall finding: 20 percent of students said
                        sexual assault and misconduct is very or extremely
                        problematic on their own campus. The AAU survey had a
                        total response rate of 19 percent.)

                        were victims of non-consensual sexual contact through
                        force or in situations when they were incapacitated and
                        unable to consent. Among undergraduate men, the rate was
                        7 percent.

                    <p>
                        Ten percent of undergraduate women said they suffered
                        incidents involving non-consensual sexual penetration or
                        attempted penetration. Thirty-five percent of students
                        said sexual assault and misconduct is very or extremely
                        problematic at the school.
                    </p>
                    <p>The survey response rate was 36 percent.</p>

                        “For Brown, the report reinforces our Sexual Assault
                        Task Force’s call to action for confronting the very
                        real problem of gender-based harassment and violence,”
                        Brown President Christina Paxson said. “The results of
                        the survey establish a clear baseline against which we
                        can assess ourselves going forward and will continue to
                        inform ongoing education and prevention efforts to
                        address these problems.”

                        attempted penetration. Two percent of students said

                        president for student affairs. “While any misconduct
                        that our students suffer is regrettable, we do feel that

                        core data confirm our understanding that sexual
                        harassment and assault take place at unacceptable rates
                        and cause harm both to individuals and to our community.
                        As members of a university community, each of us must
                        recognize this happens in our midst, act to prevent it,
                        and provide support when incidents occur.” He announced
                        that a task force of students, faculty and
                        administrators would work on strategies.
