            Black People Are Disproportionately Affected By the Prison System
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Findings from Pew Research show racial disparities amongst
            incarcerated peoples.
        </h2>
        <h3>By Nyla Cherry</h3>
        <p>
            Citizens who identify as Black are significantly more likely to be
            sent to jail. They are also significantly more likely to remain
            incarcerated for longer periods of time than their peers. These
            statistics are so alarming because Black people makeup such a small
            portion of Americans yet such a large portion of prison populations.
